It includes archival ""home movie"" footage, as well as interviews with William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, and other ""beat"" era writers who knew Bowles and his wife Jane during his 50 years in Morocco.

He discusses his philosophy on writing (he basically doesn't have one), his life with Jane, his homosexuality, and his complex relationship with his adopted country. This film does not earn a higher rating, because it teases more than it tells . . . probably due to the difficulty of getting information from Bowles.

2909,"""Five Wives"" etc. is a fascinating and bravely personal documentary that will be loved by any fans of the genre. It echoes McElwee's ""Sherman's March"" in its dissection of southern mores and gender roles. But in her examination of her larger-than-life father -- an oft-married Houston multi-millionaire now in his 70s -- film-maker Tessa Blake's inquiry into her unusual extended family reaches much deeper than even McElwee would dare to tread. Numerous interviews with family friends provide lots of humor, whether or not one is familiar with the milieu, but the film achieves more in it's second half as Blake dares to question herself and her father about the sometimes painful differences between them (mostly centering around Tessa's then-boyfriend, an African-American). A former debutante, the attractive and intelligent Blake is close enough to her subject matter to know exactly where to strike, but it is done so with the loving hand of a daughter who obviously cherishes and respects being her daddy's little girl. The exchange in the final five minutes between Tessa and ""Blakie"" offers better, more intense and heartfelt drama than a decade's worth of TV-movies and chick flicks.",
2910,"This movie was very touching, honest, sad, interesting and complete. However, it leaves Tessa ""without closure"". She wants her father to accept her biracial boyfriend, yet he denies her the opportunity. He quickly ends the conversation as the movie ends. I noticed her tears. The ONE thing she wants him to understand is beyond his social and ethical abilities, which is sad. Money and beauty is all that motivates her father. She loves her biracial boyfriend, yet leaves him, I think, because of her father and what he thinks. Her desire to make her father happy overcomes her own desires for happiness. She does not want to disappoint her father, which is very understanding. She wants to make her father happy, yet wants to be happy herself. This film was excellent. I wish I had her personal email address, which is probably impossible. She knows, as well as I do, that money is not everything in life. Her boyfriend was very intelligent, attractive and fun. Skin color is not significant when it comes to happiness. I wish you happiness, Tessa, if you read this.",
